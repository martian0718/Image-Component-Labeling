# Image-Component-Labeling
Another OOP project made in a Data Structures and Algorithm course using C++

The objective of this code is to distinguish between two different objects in an image using a binary image. A 1 signifies a pixel is of an image component while a 0 is part of the background.

The objective of component labeling is to label the component pixels so that two pixels get the same label if and only if they are pixels of the same image component.

I implemented the Stack and Queue Data structure while also incorporating encapsulation and information hiding. 

I used Depth First Searching and Breadth First Searching to find the image components.
